    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>This is a go to alternative burrito bowl for anyone who loves chipotle. It does rquire ordering Chipotle with no rice. You could also purchase your own burrito bowl ingredients, but the recipe will assume you bought the bowl from Chipotle first!</p>
    <p>For anyone who has never tried cauliflower rice, I encourage you to give it a shot. It is a low calorie, low carb alternative to rice that doesn't effect the flavor too much.</p>
